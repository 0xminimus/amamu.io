Stake away

# What is amamu?

Amamu is an independent entity which truly believes that blockchain technology will change the entire world for the better.

We have recently become Fuse network validators because we are very excited about all the projects powered by it.
We think that all of them are good examples of what the new economy should be, and that's why we are committed to doing everything we can to maintain and develop the Fuse network.

Our society has gone through a period in which everything has been centralized. Communication, law, production and finance are in the hands of very few.
And with that great power, came the great abuse. Fortunately, we are now entering a new revolution.
One that is assured by technology, and that will allow common people to regain decision-making power.
Amamu is strongly committed to helping accomplish that.

We have decided to keep our anonymity, but we are extremely open and transparent in what we do and seek.
Because it’s just a matter of how we act, not who we are. All our efforts will be aimed at strengthening the chain of collaboration.
And to do so, we encourage you to delegate your Fuse tokens to Amamu.
You’ll help maintain the health of the Fuse network and at the same time you will get staking rewards.


# Principles

- We believe in technology-based trust systems.

- We strongly advocate for the open-source-software model.

- We want the future to be transparent, reliable and fairer, that's why we love peer-to-peer networks.

- We think that blockchain technology is much more than pure financial interest. It’s a matter of freedom.

- We are thrilled to embrace and help develop the new economy. One that is non-custodial.

- We believe it is also important to run nodes on a non-incentivized testnet in order to help improve the network. Someone has to do it.

- We are convinced that without decentralization real change will never occur.
  Therefore, we must try to avoid the concentration of staking in the hands of a few.
  But there are other aspects to be considered, as well, such as diversity of location, data centers and software used by the nodes.

# Why Staking?

If you are a holder of Fuse Token you can easily earn an interest on them, in a manner that is decentralized and non-custodial.
Just get your rewards by delegating your tokens to a validator.

This will give you some of the benefits of staking without the costs related to running your own node.

Don’t forget that staking is non-custodial, so you will keep the control of your tokens all the time.

# How to stake with Amamu?

We welcome all kinds of delegators, from institutional to individual holders. Each one of them will be considered the same.
